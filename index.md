I am Shubh Prakash, a 3rd year Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am majoring in mathematics from the Mathematics Department. 



Research Interests
My primary interest area is cryptography, and currently I am exploring zero knowledge proofs, secure multi party computation, secret sharing, computing on encrypted data
(homomorphic encryption) etc.
Besides this, I am interested in related areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, like computational number theory and algebra, complexity theory, 
and distributed computing. 
In the future. I do hope to explore and work in other areas of cryptography as well.
